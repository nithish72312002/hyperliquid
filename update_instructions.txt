1. Update version in package.json
2. Commit the files you want to push to npm package (DO NOT COMMIT PACKAGE.JSON)
3. git push
4. commit your package.json file and write commit message "bump"
5. git push
6. git tag v1.4.0 #replace with ur actual version
7. git push origin v1.4.0 #replae with actual version 


Need to do it this way and commit package.json after, bc for some reason github actions runs npm publish
on the second most recent commit, not the most recent one idk why
